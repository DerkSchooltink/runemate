# Opensource RuneMate bots

This repository serves as a way for people to get into writing bots for RuneMate. 

Runemate is a platform that allows users to automate aspects of the game RuneScape. 

**Warning: using cheats is against the terms of service from RuneScape**

Personally, writing these bots has helped me get into development, specifically Java and Kotlin. I have used open source bots before to learn how bots work. This is the reason behind this repository: completing the circle of learning.

##Setup
So obviously there are some aspects in the repository which has been censored to avoid people directly stealing this bot and uploading it. Manifest files containing internal ID's have been removed and I've had requests from people I used to work together with to remove some of the source code, mainly regarding the UI aspect. This is up to the user (you) to implement later on.

This project uses Gradle to build. Sadly, RuneMate does not support Gradle for downloading dependencies, such as the RuneMate jar. I've set up a build.gradle.kts that takes care of this for you.
